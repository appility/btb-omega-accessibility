# Notes on accessibility

Digital accessibility refers to the practice of building digital content and applications that can be used by a wide range of people, including individuals who have visual, motor, auditory, speech, or cognitive disabilities.

There is also a strong business case for accessibility: studies show that accessible websites have better search results, they reach a bigger audience, they’re SEO friendly, have faster download times, they encourage good coding practices, and they always have better usability.

> Designing a product from scratch
> that meets the requirements for accessibility
> shouldn’t add additional cost and effort.
> but fixing a site that is already inaccessible may require considerable effort.
